# Flutter Dev Container for Android

This project provides a pre-configured development container for building Flutter applications in Android.

Runs on Windows (WSL2 recommended), MacOS (see note at the end) and Linux (at least in theory, please someone test it).

> [!IMPORTANT]
> The container currently builds for the amd64 architecture regardless of the host system due to compatibility issues with Apple Silicon chips.
> I will eventually investigate native architecture builds later, but for now this will do.

## Prerequisites

- Docker
- VSCode, or most VSCode forks, or DevPod and most IDEs (see later tip)
- Ability to read

## Getting Started

1. **Open in Dev Container:** Open this project in VS Code and allow it to open in a Dev Container. This will build the Docker image and start the container.

> [!NOTE]
> The first time is gonna take a while, depending on how fast your internet is. This is because the SDKs and tools that need to be downloaded are relatively large (5GB approximately).

2. **Connect your Android Device:**

    - Enable developer mode and Wireless debugging on your Android device.
    - Click on 'Pair device with pairing code'.
    - Open a new terminal in VS Code.
    - Run the following command, replacing `YOUR_DEVICE_IP:PORT` with the IP and PORT displayed on your phone in the second step:

        ```bash
        task pair-device -- YOUR_DEVICE_IP:PORT
        ```

        Input the pairing code.
    - After pairing, run this other command, with the IP address and PORT displayed in the Wireless debugging page (note that the port is different)

        ```bash
        task connect-device -- YOUR_DEVICE_IP:PORT
        ```

3. **Verify Connection:**

    - Run `flutter doctor` in the terminal.
    - Confirm that a green checkmark appears next to "Connected device".

> [!TIP]
> You can also use this devcontainer with other IDEs using [DevPod](https://devpod.sh/). It's free and open source!
>
> **Important Note for Alternative IDEs:** Some IDEs might default to the `sh` shell instead of `bash`, which is the shell configured in this devcontainer. If you're using an IDE other than VS Code, please ensure your terminal is configured to use `bash` to avoid potential compatibility issues.
---
> [!WARNING]
> Currently only Wireless connection is supported.
> Android 10 and older devices, an extra step going through USB debugging, which is not yet fully supported.

## Included Tools and Features

- Debian 12 base (Dev Containers)
- Flutter SDK (stable channel), pre-cached for Android during image build
- Android SDK and Command Line Tools, including:
    - platform-tools
    - platforms: android-35 and android-34
    - build-tools: 35.0.0 and 34.0.0
    - CMake 3.22.1
    - NDK 26.3.11579264
- OpenJDK 17 (JAVA_HOME set in the container)
- Chromium installed (CHROME_EXECUTABLE=/usr/bin/chromium)
- Native build tooling: clang, cmake, ninja, pkg-config
- VS Code extensions preinstalled: Dart, Flutter, Task, YAML
- Starship prompt (via devcontainer feature)
- Go Task (via devcontainer feature)
- Customizable bash profile: `.devcontainer/.bashrc` is mounted as `~/.bashrc.extra`

> [!NOTE]
> Web and Linux desktop targets are disabled by default in this devcontainer (you can enable them later with `flutter config`).

## Container configuration highlights

- Architecture: forced to linux/amd64 (see devcontainer runArgs). This matches the IMPORTANT note above for Apple Silicon.
- Base image: `mcr.microsoft.com/devcontainers/base:debian-12` (final stage)
- Default user: `vscode`; default shell set to `/bin/bash`
- Environment variables set:
    - ANDROID_SDK_ROOT and ANDROID_HOME
    - FLUTTER_SDK_ROOT
    - JAVA_HOME=/usr/lib/jvm/java-17-openjdk-amd64
    - PATH includes: Android cmdline-tools, platform-tools, and `flutter/bin`
- On first build, the image runs:
    - `flutter config --android-sdk <sdk path>`
    - `flutter precache --android`
    - `flutter doctor -v` (non-fatal if it reports issues during build)
- On container create (`.devcontainer/on-create.sh`):
    - Disables Dart/Flutter analytics
    - Disables web and Linux desktop targets: `flutter config --no-enable-web` and `--no-enable-linux-desktop`
    - Runs `flutter doctor`
    - Initializes Starship prompt in your `~/.bashrc`
- On attach (`.devcontainer/post-attach.sh`):
    - Runs `flutter pub get`
    - Adjusts Git settings for mounted workspaces (Windows-friendly):
        - `core.filemode=false`, `core.autocrlf=true`, marks this repo as a safe directory

## Task shortcuts (Go Task)

This repo uses [Task](https://taskfile.dev/) inside the container. Useful commands:

- Pair device over Wiâ€‘Fi (run once per device):

    ```bash
    task pair-device -- IP_ADDRESS:PORT
    ```

- Connect to the device after pairing:

    ```bash
    task connect-device -- IP_ADDRESS:PORT
    ```

- List all tasks:

    ```bash
    task -l
    ```

That's it! You're now ready to start developing Flutter apps for Android in a consistent and isolated environment.

## Current issues

1. Macs with Apple Silicon chips are forced to use the amd64 builds.
2. On these devices, compiling the app via `flutter run` succeeds, and hot reloading is fully functional. However, you may see this file watching error during the first debug session (or after cleaning the project):

    ```sh
    Caught exception: Couldn't poll for events, error = 4
    Error while receiving file changes
    net.rubygrapefruit.platform.NativeException: Couldn't poll for events, error = 4
        at net.rubygrapefruit.platform.internal.jni.AbstractNativeFileEventFunctions$NativeFileWatcher.executeRunLoop0(Native Method)
        at net.rubygrapefruit.platform.internal.jni.AbstractNativeFileEventFunctions$NativeFileWatcher.executeRunLoop(AbstractNativeFileEventFunctions.java:42)
        at net.rubygrapefruit.platform.internal.jni.AbstractFileEventFunctions$AbstractFileWatcher$1.run(AbstractFileEventFunctions.java:154)
    ```

    **Simple workaround**: If you see this error, just stop the debug session and restart it. The error only occurs during the initial build when Gradle is establishing file watchers in the cross-architecture environment. Once the build artifacts and cache are created, subsequent runs won't show this error. The error doesn't affect functionality - hot reload and the application will work properly.
